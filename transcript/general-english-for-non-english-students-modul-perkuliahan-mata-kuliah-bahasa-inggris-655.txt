General English for non-English students Pengantar
Pembelajaran Bahasa Inggris, khususnya di program S1 FIP UNY, memiliki karakteristik tersendiri karena mata kuliah bahasa Inggris sebagai mata kuliah umum (MKU), dan biasanya mahasiswa sudah pernah belajar Bahasa Inggris sebelumnya, yaitu di tingkat SLTP dan SLTA sehingga diasumsikan bahwa mereka sudah pernah tahu dan menguasai kaidah-kaidah dasar Bahasa Inggris yang meliputi English basic skills atau kemampuan dasar bahasa Inggris ( Speaking, reading, wariting dan listening) dan mempunyai bekal konsep tentang English component atau unsur-unsur yang ada dalam bahasa inggris (Vocabulary, Grammar/structure, dan pronounciation). Hanya saja mungkin pengetahuanpengetahuan tentang kaidah-kaidah Bahasa Inggris tersebut masih perlu diluruskan, ditata secara sistematik dan dikembangkan lebih lanjut.
Dalam proses pembelajaran bahasa Inggris tentunya perlu kiranya untuk terus dilakukan penataan kembali pola pemahaman dan juga materi atau bahan ajar bahasa Inggris secara sistematis dalam bentuk skemata atau konsep-konsep yang lebih simple dan mudah untuk dipahami, karena mengingat karakteristik mahasiswa FIP yang bukan mahasiwa program bahasa sehingga diperlukan desain materi yang yang lebih sederhana
Modul ini memuat ringkasan materi bahasa Inggris dengan didikuti latihanlatihan soal yang disusun secara sederhana dan sistematis menurut kaidah-kaidah gramatika Bahasa Inggris tertentu, yang dianggap esensial sebagai dasar untuk mengembangkan ketrampilan bahasa lisan maupun tulisan (spoken / written) seperti pola-pola dasar kalimat bahasa Inggris, words, phrases, , clauses, tenses, gerunds and present participles, conditional sentences, determiners, passive vioice, reported speech, dan verb patterns, etc.

General English for non-English students Exercise 4.
Read the passage below and study the use of the pronoun it in the passage.
It is that coal, oil and gas are badly needed for industries. Thousands tons of these fuels are used daily. But their supplies may not last for a century. It has been necessary for men to find something to take their place. And scientist believed that it is possible to get energy from something other than these fuels. Then what it will be?
Look at the sun. Though very far away from the earth. It is said that each day it pours several thousand times as much energy as men use. It has been estimated that enough energy falls in the square miles of the Arizona desert in one day to run all the industries in the country for a day and night.
In a way, the energy that sun gives is unlimited, and it is free to obtain. But it a pity that the equipment needed to capture the suns energy is still very expensive. The sun energy can be used to create very high temperatures that can melt metals. It will be possible for men to cook dinner on a stove that used the heat of the sun. the energy can also be used In telephone communication. Space travel and farming.
But how to make the suns energy continues seems to be one of the great problems. But once the problems are solved, the supply of energy will haven limit.
