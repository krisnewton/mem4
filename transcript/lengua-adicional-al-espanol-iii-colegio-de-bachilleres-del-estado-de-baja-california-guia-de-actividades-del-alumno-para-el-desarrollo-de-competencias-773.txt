PRESENTACIÓN
En el Marco de la Reforma Integral de la Educación Media Superior, Colegio de Bachilleres del Estado de Baja California (CBBC), se ha propuesto la meta de formar y consolidar el perfil de egreso en el bachiller, poniendo a disposición del alumno los elementos necesarios que le permitan crecer y desarrollar conocimientos, habilidades, actitudes y valores para poder enfrentar los retos de un mundo globalizado, vertiginoso, competitivo y complejo. Por tanto, es importante que el proceso educativo implemente estrategias que contemplen actividades de aprendizaje en diversos contextos y escenarios reales, donde el estudiante con creatividad, habilidad y destreza sepa desarrollar, movilizar y transferir las competencias adquiridas.
En virtud de lograr lo anterior y consciente de la dificultad para que el alumnado tenga acceso a una bibliografía adecuada, pertinente y eficaz con el entorno socio-económico actual, el CBBC brinda la oportunidad a los estudiantes de contar con materiales didácticos para el óptimo desarrollo de los programas de estudio de las asignaturas que comprende el Plan de Estudios Vigente. Cabe subrayar que, dichos materiales son producto de la participación de docentes de la Institución, en los cuales han manifestado su experiencia, conocimientos y compromiso en pro de la formación de los jóvenes bachilleres.
Cabe señalar que, los materiales se encuentran en un proceso permanente de revisión y actualización por parte de los diferentes equipos docentes así como del equipo editorial. Las guías se pueden consultar en la página Web del CBBC: www.cobachbc.edu.mx en la sección alumnos / material didáctico.
Es necesario, hacer énfasis que esta guía no debe ser tomada como la única herramienta de trabajo y fuente de investigación, ya que es imprescindible que los estudiantes lleven a cabo investigaciones de consulta en otras fuentes bibliográficas impresas y electrónicas, material audiovisual, páginas Web, bases de datos, entre otros recursos didácticos que apoyen su formación y aprendizaje.
La guía de actividades en la presente edición, está organizado con la intención de desarrollar las cuatro habilidades necesarias para el dominio de un idioma. Primero busca fortalecer las habilidades de lectura y escritura para después desarrollar las auditivas y orales. Cabe señalar que este proceso es indispensable para lograr la producción oral. El alumno produce únicamente cuando ha integrado a sus procesos cognitivos nuevas formas estructurales, de manera sistemática y cíclica así como vocabulario de nuevo uso.
Así mismo, esta edición pretende integrar las explicaciones de las formas gramaticales para facilitar al docente su trabajo dentro del aula. Cuenta con ejercicios suficientes que buscan integrar de manera progresiva las formas gramaticales. La repetición en distintos esquemas permite aprender de una manera más efectiva (Bob Bjork y John Dunlosky; The Science of Daily Thinking, 2014). El contar con la edición impresa te ahorrará tiempo y te permitirá enfocarte en la explicación y monitoreo del profesor así como la coordinación de las actividades sugeridas que deberás realizar y para ello, debes usar el idioma en contextos comunicativos y así mejorarás tu dominio de manera efectiva.

To describe situations that involve cause-effect
Learning Activity This is your third semester in high school; you're now with new classmates. Do you already know them? Recalling what you learned last semester: do you remember the topics from the previous semester? Do you remember the test at the beginning? Discuss with your classmates and teacher the different kinds of evaluations that you remember.
FRAME / DIAGNOSTIC TEST:
One.Ice breaker dynamic: Two.Introduce yourself with a partner and then to the group. Three.Your teacher must describe the main contents of the subject and then you have to establish the classroom rules. Four.Answer the diagnostic exam. Five.Calculate your test results and analyze them according with the group average results.
Skills to demonstrate:
· The student must identify the main ideas of an oral or written text. · The student must identify in oral and writing communicates the causes and effects of events. · The student must use the grammatical structures of first conditional and zero conditional to
exchange information about cause and effect.
Learning Activities: Perhaps you've already heard about the cause- effect; what do you think it means? This relationship means that everything we do sets in motion a cause and it brings a positive or negative result that will depend on the cause set in motion; what would happen if you eat too much junk food? What are the consequences, if you stay up late every night?
1. Think about the cause-effect relationship: Every or each act do we make, it has consequences: what do you think would happen if you overeat, or you drop your studies, or waste too much time in front of the TV or in Facebook?
Zero Conditional
The 0 (zero) conditional is the easiest to understand! It is also called the real or factual conditional because it is used to talk about facts, or something that is always true.
If I eat too much, I get sick.

EXAMPLES:
If I go to a friend's house for dinner, I usually take a bottle of wine or some flowers. When I have a day off from work, I often go to the beach. If the weather is nice, she walks to work. Jerry helps me with my homework when he has time. I read if there is nothing on TV. What do you do when it rains? I stay at home. Where do you stay if you go to Sydney?
IMPORTANT If / When
Both "if" and "when" are used in the Present Real Conditional. Using "if" suggests that something happens less frequently. Using "when" suggests that something happens regularly.
EXAMPLES: When can be used instead of if: When I cook fish, the house always smells. I always smoke when I drink. When I go to the movies, I eat a bag of popcorn.
Zero Conditional
-- Skill: To apply time expressions use in present trough different situations. -- Informative objective: Zero conditional form
-- Formative: Every even in our life is conditioned

Write them: 1.- _________________________________________________ 2.- _________________________________________________ 3.-__________________________________________________ 4.-__________________________________________________ 5.-__________________________________________________
The first Conditional It's used to talk about things which might happen in the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen in the future, but this describes possible things, which could easily come true.
Examples: · If I study, I will pass the test. · If I don't study I won't pass the test. · If my sister studies, she will pass the test, · If she doesn't study, she won't pass · If you don't work hard, you won't get what you desire most. · You won't get what you desire most if you don't work hard. · If we, Mexicans don't care about our culture, it will disappear.

MODAL VERBS: ADVICE AND OBLIGATION

 The word modal comes from the word mood, (disposition, humor). The use of the modal next to a verb gives certain sense or intention; it changes the meaning of the verb. The modals that are we going to learn are: MUST, SHOULD, MAY, HAVE TO, COULD, WOULD

 You will never see a modal next to a verb that has a ­ing termination, or in past tense, or in 3rd. person form (-s,-es,-ies). The verb has to be in the main, simple or basic form.

Examples:

· You must remember this. · You should practice them whenever you can. · You have to use this information. · You may need it someday.

MODAL VERBS and HAVE TO Basic meanings

Past Ability Permission Possibility Polite Request

Taken from: https://es.pinterest.com/pin/258112622369979146/

 We can use modals other than will in the main clause of a sentence in the first conditional:

If you ask George, he may/might be able to help you. (Possibility) You can/may leave the room if you've finished the test. (Permission) If he doesn't come soon, we must / will have to leave without him. (Obligation) If you ever go to Chicago, you should take a boat trip on the river. (Suggestion) If you don't watch your steps, you are going to fall over. (Prediction)

Writing Activity: · Imagine that you are going to go on a long holiday. Write sentences with must/ mustn't or
should / shouldn't. · Use the following expressions:

-write to my parents every week -lose my passport -look after my money -phone every day -talk to strangers -go out alone when it is dark -drink too much alcoholic drinks -have a bath/ shower every day -go dangerous place -swim far into the sea
Playing a game to practice modals
Speaking Activity: In pairs take turns to give advice to your classmate

How to play
- Players give advice using appropriate language.
- The number of pieces of advice needed to continue until they read all of them.

Moving
- Players go from top to bottom choosing their own path starting from Go. They can roll a die and follow the numbered squares, losing a turn on the Danger squares.

Team Work Self and Peer Assessment Sheet

Group projects are sometimes looked upon as being "unfair". Through the use of this self and peer assessment sheet your perception of quantity of work that you performed and that of your partners is analyzed against the perceptions of your partner. Through this process, hopefully equity is achieved. In order for this process to work effectively there is the need for you to be honest and objective. NAME:____________________

After school my friends and I went to the movies. While we were deciding what movie we wanted to see, next to us a couple of girls arrived, and there she was, the girl I liked. So, I decided to invite them to see the movie with us. I didn't have change to pay for my ticket so she paid for it, and I offered to buy the popcorn.

Colonial Mexico Spaniards built magnificent cathedrals and Missions. In Baja California we can find some in San Ignacio, Loreto, Mulegé and San Borja. Catholic missionaries entered the country with the Spanish conquerors and immediately began working to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The church became enormously wealthy. They helped Spanish control over the indigenous peoples of colonial México, introducing Spanish culture and language to the Native Americans as trying to convert them to Christianity.
Race and Social Class A multiracial society made up of people of mixed Native American, European, African, and Asian
heritage. Mestizos, or people of mixed European and Native American descent, were the biological and cultural bridge between Spaniards and Native Americans.
An estimated 200,000 African slaves were brought. Racial mixing and intermarriage produced mulattos; Race was a sure indicator of social class immediately after the conquest. The highest social class was the peninsulares, the criollos, people of European descent born in the Americas; the resentment of the criollos against the more privileged peninsulares became an influential force in Mexican independence. Below the criollos were the mestizos, followed by the Native Americans and the blacks.
Economy An important aspect of the early colonial economy of México was the exploitation of Native
Americans. They performed much of the farming, mining, and ranching work in the colony. Free blacks (African slaves) worked in the ports of cities such as Veracruz and Acapulco, and labored in mines, factories, plantations, and sugar mills.

Young Martin's Promise Martin Luther King Jr., grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, in the 1930s. When he was a boy, Martin played tag and catch with his friends. His best friends lived across the street from him. Like Martin they were good ball players. But most of all, they were good friends.
Things became to change when Martin and his friends started school. Martin hoped that he and his friends would go to school together. But in 1935 there were places where black children could not go to the same school as white children. When the buss came to pick up Martin on the first day of school, his friends were not on it. All the children on the buss were black. All the children at Martin's school were too. When Martin got home from school that day, he was very excited. He couldn't wait to tell his friends about his first day of school. As he jumped off the school bus, he saw that some of his friends were already playing ball. Martin ran over to them. He wanted to join the game, as he always did but this time, the other children stopped playing. "Our parents say we can't play with you anymore," his friend told Martin. Martin asked why not. His friends said that it was because they were white and Martin was black. "That's why we don't go to the same school," another boy told Martin. Martin had to go to the black school. Martin did not know what to say. He swallowed hard and went back across the street slowly. He was very upset. Martin knew he had not done anything wrong. That night, he told his parents what happened. Martin's mother felt sorry for her son. In a calm voice, she told him that the law said that black people and white people could not be together in some places, such as school. When Martin became a man, he worked hard to change the laws that kept people apart. He spoke about bringing people together. He described his dream that all children would one day play and study together. Because of Martin and others like him, the laws changed. Now all children can go to the same school. Because of Marti Luther King Jr., kids of all colors can just be friends.

Identifying the Past
-- Skill: Understand and identify the proper word used in the Past. -- Informative objective: To distinguish the correct time expressions.
-- Formative value: To identify the proper time expression in Past.
Grammar: Understand the correct use of the time expressions in past.
 In order to show when an action or situation happened in the past, particular words and phrases (time adverbials) are often used. Here are some of the most common ones:
1. Yesterday: This refers to the day before today, but not at any specific time. The day before yesterday. This time adverbial has the same meaning as two days ago.
Example: Omar and I went to the movies yesterday. I played in the baseball yesterday. Yesterday I ate pizza in the party.
2. Last + noun: This time adverbial is similar to yesterday, but it can be used with many different time references.
Example: My parents visited me last night. Last week I went to the dentist. My wedding anniversary was last month.
3. a / an / one + noun + ago: A singular noun phrase showing a period of time.
Example: I saw Larry a / one minute ago. My English exam was an / one hour ago. A / One week ago we went to San Francisco.
4. Plural number or expression + ago: A plural noun phrase showing a period of time is used before ago.
Example: I saw Larry two minutes ago. My English exam was three hours ago. Several days ago we went to San Francisco.
5. the + noun + before last: This common time adverbial is similar to the day before yesterday, but it can be used for many more time references.
Example: The night before last my sister's car was stolen. I finished all my work the week before last. My boyfriend's birthday was the month before last.

The Ringling Brothers The Ringling brothers woke up early in the morning on circus day. They ran down to the river to see the circus boat come in. Al was the oldest. He was eighteen years old. Then came Gus, sixteen; Otto, twelve; Alfred Theodore, called Alf T., eight; Charlie, six; and John, who was only four. At home was Henry the baby. They ran after the circus band and followed along behind it. They marched in time to the music of the circus parade. Together they crowded into the tent put up for the big circus show.

All of them held their breath as a man walked a rope stretched tight above their heads. They blinked as a juggler made plates spin. They gasped at riders who stood on galloping horses. When the acrobat turned somersaults in the air, they whistled and clapped. They laughed at the clown who tried to do it too. For a long time after the circus had left McGregor, the sounds of the wonderful calliope rang in their ears. "What's the matter with them?" Papa Ringling wondered.
Mama Ringling rolled her eyes towards the ceiling as if it were easy to tell. "The circus is what is the matter with them," she said.
"Someday we're going to have a circus of our own," Al said. He stretched a rope over the hay in his father barn. He began to practice tightrope walking.
They'd soon forget about the circus, their father though. They'd all be harness makers one day, as he was. "It's something they'll grow out of," Mama Ringling said hopefully.
One by one, the Ringling brothers grew into strong young men with cheerful round faces and glossy black hair. But they didn't outgrow their love for the circus.
They began to plan for the show in a ring under a Big Top. They started with the help of a real circus clown. His name was Yankee Robinson. Yankee was an old man with white whiskers. He had worked in circuses for forty years and he knew all about the circus business. The Ringling made him their partner.
They followed his advice and bought canvas for one Big Top and one little top. They built benches for seats under the Big Top. They bought old farm wagons, painted and decorated them, and hired big farm horses to pull the wagons. For a side show, they got a farmer who had taught his pig to do tricks. The pig was their only trained animal.
The new Ringling Circus opened in the town of Baraboo in May 1884. Reading Comprehension Skills: · Read again the Ringling Brothers story and complete the sentences with the words in bold that are in the text.

To describe activities that took place in the past

Past Progressive

-- Skill: Understand and identify the Past Progressive. -- Informative objective: To distinguish the Past Progressive from Past Simple.
-- Formative value: To identify the correct ending of the verb.

Grammar: Reviewing the Past Progressive rules (-ing).

Do you remember the rules to add the ­ing ending? Let's review them again!

 The letters -ing are added to verbs to show the present tense.

Example: I am writing a letter.

 Basic Rules Rule 1: add -ing to most words

mail + ing = mailing

carry + ing =carrying

always keep the y before adding the ing ending

Rule 2: if the word ends in -e, drop the -e and add -ing

ride + ing = riding

take + ing = taking

Rule 3: if the word is short and ends with a vowel/consonant, double the consonant and add -ing stop + ing = stopping wrap + ing = wrapping

Special: if a word has a double -e, do not drop the second -e See + ing = seeing change -ie to -y before adding -ing die + ing = dying note: the word die means to pass away and the word dye means to color

dye + ing = dyeing

 Form of the Past Progressive

Subject+ was / were + verb+ ing Examples: You were studying when she called. Were you studying when she called?

39

Block III
You were not studying when she called.
Grammar: Past Progressive Uses.
USE 1 Interrupted Action in the Past Use the Past Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past was interrupted. The interruption is usually a shorter action in the Simple Past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time.
Examples: I was watching TV when she called. When the phone rang, she was writing a letter? While we were having a picnic, it started to rain. You were not listening to me when I told you to turn the oven off.
USE 2 Specific Time as an Interruption In USE 1, described above, the Past Continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the Simple Past. However, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.
Examples: Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner. At midnight, we were still driving through the desert. Yesterday at this time, I was sitting at my desk at work.
IMPORTANT In the Simple Past, a specific time is used to show when an action began or finished. In the Past Continuous, a specific time only interrupts the action.
Examples: Last night at 6 PM, I ate dinner. I started eating at 6 PM. Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner. I started earlier; and at 6 PM, I was in the process of eating dinner.
USE 3 Parallel Actions
When you use the Past Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both actions were happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.
Examples: I was studying while he was making dinner. Were you listening while he was talking? Thomas wasn't working, and I wasn't working either. They were eating dinner, discussing their plans, and having a good time.
40

To describe activities that took place in the past

Past Progressive: While / When

While: We use it when we do two actions at the same time.

I was studying while I was listening to music. When: We use it when an action is interrupted by another action.

I was studying when she called.

Exercise 6: Reading Skills Nurse in Iconic Times Square Kiss Photo Dies at 91

BY MARC SILBER ON JUNE 23, 2010 "Edith Shain, the woman depicted in an iconic photograph kissing a sailor in Times Square at the end of World War II, has died. She was 91. The famed photo, snapped by Life photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt, shows a young woman in a nurse's uniform at the mercy of a particularly excited young sailor. The pair's lips are locked in a vehement kiss -- a scene that would become one of the most iconic images of the war. As Eisenstaedt describes it in his autobiography: "I was walking through the crowds on V-J Day, looking for pictures. I noticed a sailor coming my way. He was grabbing every female he could find and kissing them all -- young girls and old ladies alike. Then I noticed the nurse, standing in that enormous crowd. I focused on her, and just as I'd hoped, the sailor came along, grabbed the nurse, and bent down to kiss her." For decades the woman's identity was unknown, until finally in the '70s Shain contacted Life magazine. She went on to reveal that she had been working at Doctor's Hospital in New York when on August 14, 1945 she decided to take the subway to join a V-J Day (Victory over Japan) celebration in Times Square. "This guy grabbed me and we kissed," Shain said in 2008 of the sheer spontaneity of the kiss. "And then I turned one way and he turned the other. There was no way to know who he was, but I didn't mind because he was someone who had fought for me." "As for the picture," she said, "it says so many things -- hope, love, peace and tomorrow. The end of the war was a wonderful experience, and that photo represents all those feelings." Over the years Shain would lead numerous memorial parades honoring World War 2 veterans, and she spent much of her later years educating others about the sacrifices made during the war. As for the sailor in the photograph, his identity is still unconfirmed. Note we are now running a contest about this photo."

He put on his white coat and entered the mortuary. It was strange because it was only 4 o'clock. He called their names out, but no one answered. Ismael felt a little angry. He looked at the body. It wasn't lying on the table in the middle of the room where it used to be. It was on the floor, but it was still covered with a white sheet. He walked towards it when he suddenly got very cold. Then, he was a silver mist coming out from under the sheet. Ismael was trembling. The sheet was moving and now the body was sitting up, but it wasn't Mr. Holmes. It was a body without a head or skin. The body was walking towards him. Ismael couldn't move.

To request and give instructions

Learning activities:

Alex has found some dialogues in a novel in English in which some sentences contain some verbs consisting of two words, but Alex cannot figure out the meaning. Some of them are commands, requests and instructions that he does not understand very well, so he asks his sister about them. Susana explains to his brother Alex the difference between common verbs and two words verbs and some of their different meanings.

How can you distinguish a regular verb of one of this type, called two-word verbs? How can you tell a verb from regulating an idiomatic expression (also called a two-word verb)?

1. Carefully read the list of verbs that appear in the box.

A combination of verb and preposition is called a PHRASAL VERB:

VERBS and PREPOSITIONS

Apologize for ask about ask for belong to bring up care for find out

give up grow up look for look forward to look up make up pay for

prepare for study for talk about think about trust in work for worry about

1. With the vocabulary that you already know, try to interpret each word in the list and give it a meaning in your own language.
2. Compare and share with your classmate until you have the meaning of the list of two-word verbs. 3. Write some sentences with the phrasal verbs of the previous chart in which you give an order,
ask directions, or request for something and write them down in your notebook. 4. Read your sentences to a classmate, and try to interpret them.

Clarify your doubts with your teacher and discuss in class if the meanings are the real ones.

PHRASAL VERBS

Phrasal verbs are mainly used in spoken English and informal texts. (The more formal a conversation or text, the less phrasal verbs are found.)

Phrasal verbs consist of a verb and a particle (preposition, adverb). The particle can change the meaning of the verb completely. For example:

· look up ­ consult a reference book (look a word up in a dictionary) · look for ­ seek (look for her ring) · look forward ­ anticipate with pleasure (look forward to meeting someone)

There are no rules that might explain the meaning of phrasal verbs. All you can do is look them up in a good dictionary and study their meanings.

61

Block IV

Position of the Particle:

In some cases the particle is placed either after the verb or after the object. Example:

·

Write down the word

·

Write the word down

If the object is a pronoun, however, the particle has to be placed after the pronoun (object). Example:

·

Write it down.

·

Your photo album. Put it down

·

Your jacket. Take it off

You must look before you leap.
You can look up my number in the telephone directory.
Who is looking after the baby?
I look forward to meeting you.

The two most important things to remember about Phrasal verbs are; 1.- Each one has a different meaning according to the context. You have to analyze and use them carefully. The preposition or adverb changes completely the meaning of each one.
2.- English speakers use them in almost any sentence. You will hear them constantly; you have to be able to distinguish them in order to communicate.

LEARNING ACTIVITIES:
Pre-activities: Ask the students to bring magazines, scissors, glue, and white paper or carton paper. This will be necessary for the next activity. OPTIONAL do a power point presentation and share it to your classmates.
Work team and writing skills: Ask them to work in groups of 3-4 per team. They are going to review and analyze the 16- pages list that alphabetically enlists and describes 200 two word verbs.
The teacher explains that they have to choose an image that represents one phrasal verb. They are

62

To request and give instructions

going to represent a minimum of 15 phrasal verbs per team. They have to write down the sentence next to the image.

Ask them to not choose the easiest ones. Motivate them to be curious and learn new vocabulary. Tell them to sociabilize the meaning in order to represent them correctly

Stop Thief!! A group of students from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada have come up with a remote control device for protecting your car from theft. It will make all the difference. Now, you have to go to the nearest police station, report the theft, fill in a whole lot of forms, and then wait for the police to look for your stolen vehicle. It takes a long time and sometimes the car never turns up again. With this new device, all that can change. The device combines cell phones technology and the electric system in your car. When a thief steals your car all you have to do is send a SMS from your cell phone to your stolen vehicle. Just a few moments after receiving the message, the car will stop automatically. It all happens in 30 seconds!! The integrated GPS system locates your car, and sends a message to you, giving you the exact location. You then call the police and they take over. They go and pick up your car and with luck, arrest the thief! It's simply and only cost 700 USD you'll probably have your car back in just an hour or two!
B. Read the article again and answer these questions: 1. What does the new device do? 2. In the past, what did people have to do before the police help them? 3.

OBJECT PRONOUNS

Subjects are what the sentence is about.

Objects are what is affected by the action of the subject.

· I like orange juice. (I is the subject). · I read books. (Books is the object as it is receiving the action).

 Object pronouns are used instead of nouns, usually because we already know what the object is. It makes the sentence easier to read and understand and avoids repetition. We normally use object pronouns after a verb or a preposition.

Examples

I like horses.

Subject Pronoun

Horses don't like me.

Object Pronoun

We talk to our neighbor. Subject Pronoun

She talks to us.

Object Pronoun

They listen to the teacher. Subject Pronoun

We watch them on TV. Object Pronoun
